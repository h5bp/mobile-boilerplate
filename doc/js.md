### iOS Startup Image helper

## main.js

This file can be used to contain or reference your site/app JavaScript code.
For larger projects, you can make use of a JavaScript module loader, like
[Require.js](http://requirejs.org/), to load any other scripts you need to
run.

## plugins.js

This file can be used to contain all your plugins, such as jQuery plugins and other 3rd party scripts.

One approach is to put jQuery plugins inside of a `(function($){ ... })(window.jQuery);` closure to make sure they're in the jQuery namespace safety blanket.

## vendor

This directory can be used to contain all 3rd party library code.

Minified versions of the latest jQuery and Modernizr libraries are included by
default. You may wish to create your own [custom Modernizr
build](http://www.modernizr.com/download/).

[FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) polyfill is also included to remove click delays on browsers with touch UIs.
