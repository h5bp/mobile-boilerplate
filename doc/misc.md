# Miscellaneous

## .gitignore

Mobile Boilerplate includes a basic project-level `.gitignore`. This should
primarily be used to avoid certain project-level files and directories from
being kept under source control. Different development-environments will
benefit from different collections of ignores.

OS-specific and editor-specific files should be ignored using a "global
ignore" that applies to all repositories on your system.

For example, add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`, where the `.gitignore`
in your HOME directory contains the files and directories you'd like to
globally ignore:

```gitignore
[core]
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
```

## robots.txt

The `robots.txt` file is used to give instructions to web robots on what can
be crawled from the website.

By default, the file provided by this project includes the next two lines:

 * `User-agent: *` -  the following rules apply to all web robots
 * `Disallow:` - everything on the website is allowed to be crawled

If you want to disallow certain pages you will need to specify the path in a
`Disallow` directive (e.g.: `Disallow: /path`) or, if you want to disallow
crawling of all content, use `Disallow: /`.

The `/robots.txt` file is not intended for access control, so don't try to
use it as such. Think of it as a "No Entry" sign, rather than a locked door.
URLs disallowed by the `robots.txt` file might still be indexed without being
crawled, and the content from within the `robots.txt` file can be viewed by
anyone, potentially disclosing the location of your private content! So, if
you want to block access to private content, use proper authentication instead.
